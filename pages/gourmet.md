# Gourmet Synergy Guide

## Core Strategy

### Early Game
- Go into a Normal/Grass/Gourmet region to get Smoliv
- Play something else and collect gourmet Pokemon
- Capsakid add pick is the biggest sign to play gourmet
- Gourmet Pokemon are not very strong, and usually require a non-gourmet carry to buff. Try to find a strong frontline and ranged dps 
- The strategy you go for will change greatly depending on your unique
- Any berries you save from playing grass will be +10 max HP if Snorlax is added

## Snorlax
- Snorlax has several ways to scale its max HP, and an ability that benefits from this, as well as the monster synergy to carry. If Snorlax is added it will always be your frontliner, and can be itemized to carry
- Snorlax has 3 ways to gain max HP
    * 30 HP while wearing a Chef's Hat per cook
    * 20 HP for each meal from an ally
    * 10 HP for each berry eaten
- You want to immediately get on the highest level of gourmet possible, giving priority to Snorlax to wear the hat, and also immediately feed it any berries you saved
- Snorlax only has 2 item slots while the hat is on, and only one if you want to continue feeding it berries
- The best items have good scaling with tankiness
    * **Muscle Band** - best in slot item, does it all
    * **Rocky Helmet** - massive physical EHP boost
    * **Assault Vest** - massive special EHP boost
    * **Soul Dew** - Each cast will kill
    * **Upgrade** - Ramp up with monster kills
    * **X-ray Glasses** - Snorlax has low base attack speed and wants to carry
