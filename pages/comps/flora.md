# Flora Synergy Guide

## Core Strategy

### Early Game
- Go into flora or sound region for Gossifleur
- Biggest hurdle is getting on flora 3 to start generating mulch, so that is also the sign to enter flora.
- Generate as many flora, grass, and sound portals as possible to maximize Maractus odds
- There are no misses for flora uniques
- You need a flora/light/gourmet region to generate Cherubi for light

### Late Game
- The best board is Xerneas in light 5 with carry items. An attack speed item is very important
- Shaymin is a strong secondary choice with caster items.
