# Amorphous Synergy Guide

## Core Strategy

### Early Game
- **Don't force Amorphous early** - the synergy provides very little benefit in early rounds
- Focus on analyzing add picks to plan your transition
- Consider synergy stones more highly than usual, especially Ice Stone
- It's usually better to play a different earlygame comp like bug or ground while collecting useful amorph pokemon and transitioning on t10.

### Late Game
- Getting on amorph 7 doubles the stat bonus per synergy, so its usually what you want to have in on level 7
- Try to add as many additional synergies as possible on level 8/9 while keeping amorph 7 in
- On level 9 transition into dragon 3 with your two flex slots to maximize synergies. Usually you want to run Gabite + Vibrava to dig holes and add an additional unit to get the buff.

## Add Picks

### Uncommon Adds
- **Grimer** - Poison; Dark potential with Spiritomb + Darkrai region (watch for Gulpin epic add)
- **Koffing** - Poison; Artificial with Castform unique (check artifact item early!)
- **Omanyte** - Water; needs Dewpider â†’ Castform/Pyukumuku unique OR water/ground Shellos region
- **Dewpider** - Water (same as Omanyte); Bug with Caterpie
- **Sandyghast** - Ghost; Ground with Silicobra and Water/Ground Shellos region

### Rare Adds
- **Slugma** - Fire with Castform unique; Rock with Aquatic/Rock Shellos region and Nihilego legendary
- **Wynaut/Munna** - Psychic with each other, Solosis, or Mew/Deoxys legendary (Baby/Wild irrelevant)
- **Drifloon** - Ghost; Flying overlaps with Butterfree or non-amorphous Pokemon
- **Silicobra** - Ground with Sandyghast

### Epic Adds
- **Misdreavus** - Ghost; Fairy with Mimikyu or Milcery unique
- **Gulpin** - Poison with Ghastly; needs Grimer/Koffing add, Pyukumuku unique, or Nihilego legendary

### Unique Pokemon

- **Castform** - Synergizes with Slugma, Omanyte/Dewpider, or Koffing adds; Ice with Vanillite backup (better than Cryogonal)
- **Cryogonal** - Only pairs with Vanillite
- **Spiritomb** - Dark synergy with Grimer in Dark/Amorphous regions (needs Darkrai legendary); Ghost option
- **Pyukumuku** - Wants Omanyte/Dewpider; Poison likely workable
- **Mimikyu** - Perfect with Misdreavus; otherwise another ghost
- **Milcery** - Chef combo with Gulpin; Fairy with Misdreavus

### Legendary Pokemon

- **Mew** - Always hits Psychic with Reuniclus
- **Deoxys** - Same as Mew, generally superior
- **Manaphy** - Water with Omanyte/Dewpider/Ground-Water Shellos/Pyukumuku; consider water portal backup with 2+ water units; Aquatic options with Tynamo (weak) or Goomy
- **Darkrai** - Excellent synergy overlap with Spiritomb; otherwise Ghost
- **Nihilego** - Rock with Slugma (huge potential); Poison needs only one of Grimer/Koffing/Gulpin/Pyukumuku (Ghastly always available); excellent caster vs Bug/Flora
- **Melmetal** - No synergy overlap, weak choice

## Synergy Stone Priority

### High Value (Almost Always +1 Synergy)
- **Ice Stone** - Always provides extra synergy or allows Vanillite/Cryogonal substitution (awkward with Castform sometimes)

### Conditional Value
- **Fire Stone** - Works with Slugma, otherwise useless
- **Fairy Stone** - Works with Misdreavus/Mimikyu/Alcremie (don't buy until after last add pick)
- **Water Stone** - Worth it with 2+ water adds/uniques; maybe worth with just Dewpider pre-unique
- **Fossil Stone** - Good with Omanyte if you're probably playing water as well
- **Psychic Stone** - Always hits with Solosis but can be awkward if you hit a psychic legendary
- **Dark Stone** - Needs 2+ of Dark Grimer/Spiritomb/Darkrai (probably not worth with just Grimer pre-unique)

### No Value
- **Grass Stone** - Useless
- **Electric Stone** - Useless
